### _by Vaibhav Bahl_

__This is a _C program_ that uses `graphics` to makes a two player `Tic Tac Toe` in C with much better terminal experience__

## How to Run The Game:

In order to run the game You need to open and run the `Tic-Tac-Toe-PVP.cbp` in your IDE preferably [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)
